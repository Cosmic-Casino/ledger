## Introduction
Cosmic Casino is a [Cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) based blockchain that aims at providing a fair and transparent place where users are able to gamble whatever tokens they possess.

The way in which winners are extracted is completely random, transparent and fair. To do this, during the extraction we rely on the previous block hash by using such value as the seed of a deterministic random number generator.
