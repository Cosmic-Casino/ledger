# Concepts

## Draws
Over time, different draws will be held. Particularly, there will be a draw every specific amount of time.

In order to take part to a draw, users will have to buy one or more tickets before the winner is drawn. Once the draw is held, the bought tickets will not be considered valid anymore and users will have to buy new ones if the want to take part to the next draw.

For each draw, there will only be a single winning ticket drawn. The prize of each draw will be 98% of the earnings from ticket sales.

The remaining 2% of income generated thought the sale of tickets will be used as follows:
- 1% sent to the community pool, to fund for future developments
- 1% burnt

**Note**  
Draws will be held only if there are **at least 2 participants** that have entered it. If a draw expires and not enough participants have previously entered, the bough tickets will be considered valid for the next draw. This continues until a valid draw with at least 2 participants is held, without a limit on the number of invalid draws that can happen.

## Tickets
In order to obtain a ticket, a user will have to pay using the chain token `FCHS`. A single ticket will have an initial cost of `10 FCHS`.

A single user is allowed to buy as many tickets as they can afford, without any limitation.
